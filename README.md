# ChatGPT-Spacy-NetworkX
Following ChatGPT's trend and giving a visual representation of the phenom playing with SPACY and NetworkX


ChatGPT has become the next big thing among programmers, technology experts and AI professionals or users.

This work is not intended to explore its features but rather "playing" with his popularity among news for giving a visual picture.
Library used are Request,Spacy,NetworkX and Json API for The Guardian website.

Useful links for the project:

1) For getting the Guardian API Key, follow instructions here: https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer

2) Once you get the API Key on your email, you can store and use it anonymously this way: https://networkdirection.net/python/resources/env-variable

Please, note that interactivity on plots may work differently on Jupyter. In case, I upload a '.py' version of the file which works great on VS code
